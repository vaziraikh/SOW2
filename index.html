  <h2>What is a history?</h2>
  <p>The northwest of Uzbekistan and Southern Kazakhstan were submerged beneath a vast inland sea millions of years ago.
    A large plain of extremely salty earth was left behind as the waves subsided. The Aral Sea, the fourth biggest inland body of water in the world, is one of the remains of the ancient sea.The Aral Sea was a rich source of fish.Biologists were able to identify about 20 species, including sturgeon and catfish. A fishing community that also drew tourists to its seaside views was Muynak, which was situated on the coast. The Soviet Union believed that the huge plains were the best place to grow cotton in the 1950s. Water was a key component in making it happen. The Amu Darya and Syr Darya are two enormous rivers that feed the Aral Sea.</p>

    <h2> What about now?</h2>
    <p>Today, Muynak is a village in the desert more than 100 kilometers from the ocean. The only traces of the once-vibrant fishing industry are some rusted shipwrecks and an old fish processing facility. The sea now occupies around the tenth position in the world after contracting to two-fifths of its original size. A loss equal to the water in both Lakes Erie and Huron has occurred due to a 16-meter drop in water level and a 75 percent volume reduction. The ecological impact has been devastating, and the economic, social, and medical issues for the local population have been grave. A result of not being able to tolerate the toxic, salty muck, all 20 of the Aral Sea's known fish species are now gone.</p>
       <!--New paragraph-->
    <h2>What we can do?</h2>
    <p>Our main goal is to raise awareness and educate the young generation now. Please be aware and try to save water, do not pollute, and do not take it for granted. The irrational usage of water made the Sea just disappear. In addition, we should plant trees as much as we can. </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Raise awareness.</li>
    <li>Educate.</li>
    <li>Stop the climate change! </li>

    <h2> What is the position of Uzbekistan?</h2>
    <p>Position of Uzbekistan on the use of water resources of transboundary rivers in Central Asia

The Republic of Uzbekistan believes that the issue of the use of water resources in Central Asia should be considered in accordance with the universally recognized norms of international law that guarantee the rational and equitable distribution of water resources and ensure that the interests of all countries of the region are taken into account.

Given the fact that Uzbekistan currently, like other Central Asian countries located in the lower reaches of transboundary rivers, suffers a serious water shortage, the position of the Government of Uzbekistan on the use of transboundary water resources in Central Asia is as follows:

- the use of water resources of transboundary rivers in Central Asia should be solved taking into account the interests of more than 60 million people residing in all countries of the region;

- any actions carried out on transboundary rivers should not have a negative impact on the existing ecological and water balance of the region;

- the current international legal framework in the sphere of water use and ecology should become the basis for building an effective system for joint use of the resources of the transboundary rivers in Central Asia;

- the implementation of projects should be carried out on the basis of a constructive approach as well as a compromise that does not infringe upon the interests of other interested countries and guarantees two necessary conditions: prevention of the lowering of the water-balance level agreed upon by the parties for downstream countries; prevention of the violation of the ecological balance of the region.

In order to strengthen mutual understanding and trust among all the countries of Central Asia and to establish openness and transparency in relations, the Government of Uzbekistan considers it necessary to take joint efforts to find mutually acceptable and mutually beneficial solutions for resolving the rational and fair use of water resources in Central Asia.

To date, there is no other alternative to addressing the issue of distribution of transboundary water resources in the region, except for achieving a regional agreement by adopting legal instruments that promote constructive and civilized dialogue.

The Government of Uzbekistan is ready to cooperate with the Central Asian countries on the basis of these approaches in the spirit of good-neighbourly relations and friendship.</p>
