<h2>Climate Activist</h2>
<p>Vazira Ikhtiyorova is a young and passionate climate activist from Uzbekistan. Born and raised in the capital Tashkent, she won a fully-funded scholarship from Islamic Development Bank (ISDB) to pursue her bachelor's in Computer Engineering at Marmara University in Istanbul, Turkiye.</p>
<p>Through her leadership and past experiences, she has been to the United States of America, South Korea, Italy, Egypt, and other countries to expand her network and exchange ideas with fellow participants. In addition, she is the founder of the Girls Development Summit of Chilanzar District in Uzbekistan where they support girls in STEM and STEAM. She has completed many internships at prestigious companies and trying to combat climate change.</p>
<p>Her passion and great enthusiasm sparked when she was accepted for Tunza Eco-Generation as a  Regional Ambassador to Uzbekistan in 2019. So far, I was able to accomplish more than 5 online internships longing 6 months with over 60 articles on the platform and participate in the worldâ€™s largest conferences on climate change such as pre-COP, COP, COY Conferences, and several exchange programs.

Being based in Istanbul does not hinder her from raising awareness and continuing her path in climate change and environmentalism. She is quite sure that being a Computer Engineer Student will boost problem-solving and contribute to having a sustainable living for all. Vazira is glad for the opportunity she had at COY 17, she could expand network, and learn more about the views of youth on rising issues around the globe and how they would like to tackle them. She always would like to be reunited with like-minded people and start acting, as they said, small acts, big impacts. She hopes to participate in COP 28 in Dubai, UAE next year and be part of it fully.</p>
